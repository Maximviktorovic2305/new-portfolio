## 4. Animation System Design

### Animation Libraries Usage Plan
- **Three.js**: Complex particle systems in Hero section (non-geometric)
- **GSAP**: Scroll-triggered animations, timeline sequences, parallax effects
- **Framer Motion**: Component entrance animations, micro-interactions

### Animation Control Panel
- UI component for users to adjust animation intensity (Subtle, Moderate, Intense)
- Toggle to enable/disable all animations
- Settings persistence using localStorage

### Animation Context
A global AnimationContext will manage:
- Animation intensity settings (Subtle, Moderate, Intense)
- Animation enable/disable toggle
- Theme-aware color updates for animations

### Hero Section Animation
The Hero section will feature a complex, non-geometric particle system:
- Particle system with organic, fluid movements using Three.js
- Interactive particles that respond to cursor movement with attraction/repulsion physics
- Color palette based on accent color (#74dde3) with dynamic theme awareness
- Particles form conceptual patterns (energy fields, vortexes, fluid dynamics) rather than geometric shapes
- Low-opacity particle trails (0.1) for subtle visual effects
- Performance-optimized with requestAnimationFrame

### Section Transitions
- Fade in/out effects using Framer Motion with spring physics
- Staggered animations for list items with GSAP
- Scroll-triggered animations using GSAP ScrollTrigger
- Parallax effects for background elements
- Smooth page transitions between sections

### Parallax Implementation
- Multi-layer parallax backgrounds with different scroll speeds
- GSAP ScrollTrigger for precise parallax control
- Performance-optimized with transform3d for smooth animations
- Theme-responsive parallax elements

## 5. UI/UX Design

### Color Scheme
- **Primary Background**: Dark theme with deep grays (#0a0a0a to #1a1a1a)
- **Text**: Light grays (#ededed to #cccccc)
- **Accent Color**: #74dde3 (used for highlights, buttons, progress bars)
- **Progress Bars**: rgba(116, 221, 227, 0.8) (80% transparency)
- **Card Backgrounds**: Slightly lighter than primary background (#1a1a1a)

### Typography
- Primary font: Geist (via next/font)
- Secondary font: Geist Mono for code/technical elements
- Responsive font sizing using Tailwind's default scale
- Font weights: 300, 400, 500, 600, 700 for visual hierarchy

- Performance: Optimized with WebGL and requestAnimationFrame
- Custom shaders for unique visual effects

### Parallax Effects Implementation
- GSAP ScrollTrigger for scroll-based parallax animations
- Multi-layer approach with foreground, middle-ground, and background elements
- Different scroll speeds for each layer to create depth perception
- requestAnimationFrame for smooth performance
- Mobile optimization with reduced intensity on touch devices

### GSAP Animations

## 9. Theme Management

### Theme Context
- Manages current theme (dark/light)
- Handles theme transition animations
- Provides theme values to components
- Persists theme preference in localStorage

### Theme-Aware Animations
- Animations adapt to current theme
- Color values update dynamically on theme change
- Uses CSS variables for consistent color management
- MutationObserver to detect theme changes for Three.js scenes
- Dynamic color updates for particle systems based on accent color (#74dde3)

## 10. Performance Considerations

### Animation Optimization
- Code splitting for animation libraries (GSAP, Three.js, Framer Motion)
- Lazy loading for non-critical animations
- Performance monitoring for complex Three.js scenes
- Fallbacks for low-performance devices
- RequestIdleCallback for non-essential animations

### Bundle Size Management
- Tree-shaking for animation libraries
- Dynamic imports for heavy components
- Preloading critical assets
- Image optimization for project showcases
- CDN delivery for animation assets

## 11. Responsive Design

### Breakpoints
- Mobile: 0px - 768px
- Tablet: 769px - 1024px
- Desktop: 1025px+

### Responsive Animations
- Reduced motion for accessibility (prefers-reduced-motion media query)
- Adaptive animation intensity based on device performance
- Touch-friendly interactive elements
- Optimized layouts for all screen sizes
- Mobile-first animation approach with progressive enhancement

### Performance Considerations
- Disable non-essential animations on mobile devices
- Reduce particle count in Three.js scenes on lower-end devices
- Implement animation frame rate monitoring
- Use CSS transforms and opacity for performant animations

## 12. Testing Strategy

### Component Testing

### Performance Testing
- Animation frame rate monitoring (60fps target)
- Load time measurements
- Bundle size analysis
- Mobile performance testing
- Accessibility testing for reduced motion preferences

## 13. Deployment Considerations

- Alternative: Netlify or similar static hosting

### Build Optimization
- Next.js automatic static optimization
- Image optimization with Next.js Image component
- Code splitting for animation libraries
